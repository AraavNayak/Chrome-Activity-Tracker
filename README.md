# Chrome-Activity-Tracker

Browser extension built with Node.js, a background script (background.js) for tracking and logging website activity, and a Python script that visualizes the logged browsing data. The extension runs in the background to record time spent on websites in a CSV file, while the Python script processes this data and creates a pie chart representation to show time distribution across visited sites.
